# Flask_assesment

Run the Flask application: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your app.py file is located, and run the following command

---> python app/main.py

This command will start the Flask development server, and your application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or http://localhost:5000/ in your web browser.

Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your system and the path to the Python executable is set correctly.

The README file is not directly involved in running the Flask application. It's meant to provide information and instructions to users or developers who want to understand or work with your application.
